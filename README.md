# Work Day Scheduler

The code in this repo deploys a website that allows users to save events and check on them later. It saves the events and when the page is reloaded restores them to the scheduler. That way, a user can do other things and come back to the planner and still see their events.
The site can be seen here: [Scheduling Application](https://grandmaster.github.io/Scheduling-Application).

## Installation 
This site runs on any modern browser. 

## Usage
The user navigates to the site and sees a series of blocks representing hours of the day. The present time is red, the past is grey and the future is green. The application updates according to the time of day, and the currently present block is always red. When the user enters text in the block and clicks the save icon, the event is saved and will appear every time the user reloads the page. 

## Demo
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
